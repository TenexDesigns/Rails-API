To set up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in a Ruby on Rails application, you can follow these steps:

Add the rack-cors gem to your Rails project. Open your Gemfile and add the following line:


gem 'rack-cors'
Then run bundle install in your terminal to install the gem.

Configure CORS in your Rails application.
Create a new file called cors.rb in the config/initializers directory and add the following configuration:


Rails.application.config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do
  allow do
    origins '*' # Update this to the appropriate domain(s) from which you want to allow CORS requests
    resource '*', headers: :any, methods: [:get, :post, :put, :patch, :delete, :options, :head]
  end
end
In the origins section, you can specify the domain(s) from which you want to allow CORS requests.
Using '*' allows requests from any domain, but its recommended to specify specific domains for security reasons.

The resource section specifies the resources for which you want to allow CORS requests and the allowed HTTP methods.

Restart your Rails server for the changes to take effect.

With these steps, you have configured CORS in your Rails application.
The specified domains will now be allowed to make cross-origin requests to your Rails API.

To set up a controller for the Contact model with fields first_name, last_name, 
and email in a Rails API-only app, you can follow these steps:

Generate the Contact model by running the following command in your terminal:
   rails generate model Contact first_name:string last_name:string email:string
This will create a new model file in app/models/contact.rb with the specified fields.

Run the migration to create the contacts table in your database:
   rails db:migrate
Generate the Contacts controller by running the following command in your terminal:
   rails generate controller Contacts
This will create a new controller file in app/controllers/contacts_controller.rb.

Define the actions for the Contacts controller. For example, you may want to define the following actions:
   class ContactsController < ApplicationController
     def index
       contacts = Contact.all
       render json: contacts
     end

     def show
       contact = Contact.find(params[:id])
       render json: contact
     end

     def create
       contact = Contact.new(contact_params)
       if contact.save
         render json: contact, status: :created
       else
         render json: contact.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
       end
     end

     def update
       contact = Contact.find(params[:id])
       if contact.update(contact_params)
         render json: contact
       else
         render json: contact.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
       end
     end

     def destroy
       contact = Contact.find(params[:id])
       contact.destroy
       head :no_content
     end

     private

     def contact_params
       params.require(:contact).permit(:first_name, :last_name, :email)
     end
   end
This defines the index, show, create, update, and destroy actions for the Contacts controller.
Note that the contact_params method is used to whitelist the parameters that are allowed to be submitted via a form or JSON payload.

Define the routes for the Contacts controller. You can define the routes in your config/routes.rb file, for example:
   Rails.application.routes.draw do
     resources :contacts
   end
This will define the standard RESTful routes for the Contacts controller.

With these steps, you should have a fully functional Contacts controller that can handle CRUD operations 
for contacts with fields first_name, last_name, and email.
