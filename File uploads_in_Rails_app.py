To implement file uploads in a Rails API app, you can use the Active Storage feature provided by Rails.
Active Storage facilitates uploading and attaching files to your applications models.
Follow these steps to implement file uploads in your Rails API:

Install Active Storage: First, install Active Storage by running the following command:
   rails active_storage:install
This command generates a migration file to create the necessary tables for Active Storage.
Run rails db:migrate to apply the migration.

Configure Active Storage: In the config/application.rb file, include the Active Storage module:
   # config/application.rb
   require "active_storage/engine"
Configure the storage service in config/storage.yml. For local development, you can use the local disk service:

   # config/storage.yml
   local:
     service: Disk
     root: <%= Rails.root.join("storage") %>
In your config/environments/development.rb file, set the active storage service:

   # config/environments/development.rb
   config.active_storage.service = :local
Attach files to a model: To attach files to a model, use the has_one_attached or has_many_attached macros in the model.
  For example, if you want to attach an image to a Post model:
   # app/models/post.rb
   class Post < ApplicationRecord
     has_one_attached :image
   end
  
Create an upload endpoint: Create a controller action to handle file uploads.
  In this example, we'll create an upload_image action in the PostsController:
   # app/controllers/api/v1/posts_controller.rb
   class Api::V1::PostsController < ApplicationController
     def upload_image
       post = Post.find(params[:id])
       post.image.attach(params[:image])
       if post.image.attached?
         render json: { message: 'Image uploaded successfully' }, status: :ok
       else
         render json: { error: 'Failed to upload image' }, status: :unprocessable_entity
       end
     end
   end
Add a new route for the upload_image action:

   # config/routes.rb
   Rails.application.routes.draw do
     namespace :api do
       namespace :v1 do
         resources :posts do
           member do
             post :upload_image
           end
         end
       end
     end
   end
  
Test the file upload: To test the file upload, you can use a tool like Postman to send a POST request with
  a form-data payload containing the image file. Set the key to image and the value to the file you want to upload.
By following these steps, you can implement file uploads in your Rails API app using Active Storage.
This example demonstrates a basic implementation, but you can customize it according to your requirements, 
such as using different storage services or adding validations for file types and sizes. 
Refer to the Rails Active Storage Guide for more information.

To implement file uploads in a Rails API, you can follow these steps:

Set up the necessary dependencies:

Add the gem 'active_storage' to your Gemfile.
Run bundle install to install the gem.
Run rails active_storage:install to generate the required migrations and configuration files.
Run rails db:migrate to apply the migrations.
Configure your model:

Open the model where you want to attach the uploaded files (e.g., app/models/user.rb).
Add the following line to enable file attachments:

class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one_attached :avatar
end
Replace :avatar with the desired attachment name. You can have multiple attachments for a single model.
Update your controller:

In your controller action, ensure that the request is configured to accept file uploads. 
For example, if you're using JSON:

def create
  user = User.new(user_params)
  user.avatar.attach(params[:avatar]) if params[:avatar]

  if user.save
    # Handle successful response
  else
    # Handle error response
  end
end
In the example above, the avatar parameter corresponds to the file upload field in the request payload.
You can change it according to your form or request structure.
By calling user.avatar.attach, you attach the uploaded file to the associated model instance.
Update your request handling:

If youre using JSON API requests, ensure that the request headers include Content-Type: multipart/form-data for file uploads.
In your client-side application, make sure youre sending the file as a FormData object or using an
appropriate library for handling file uploads.
Retrieve and use the uploaded file:

To retrieve the attached file, you can use the url_for helper method in your views or API responses. For example:
ruby
Copy code
<%= image_tag url_for(user.avatar) %>
Handle file deletion:

If you need to delete an attached file, you can use the purge method on the attachment. For example:
ruby
Copy code
user.avatar.purge
By following these steps, you can enable file uploads in your Rails API using the Active Storage framework.
Active Storage provides various features for handling file uploads, including support for different storage services like local disk, Amazon S3, and Google Cloud Storage.
You can refer to the official Active Storage documentation for more advanced configuration and customization options.
