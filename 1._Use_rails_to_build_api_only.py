To build a Rails application as an API-only application, you can follow these steps:

Create a new Rails application with the --api flag:

rails new your_api --api

The --api flag configures the application to be API-only and sets up a minimal set of middleware suitable for building APIs.

Set up your desired database configuration in the config/database.yml file. For example, if you are using PostgreSQL:

default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  host: localhost
  username: your_username
  password: your_password
  database: your_api_development

development:
  <<: *default

test:
  <<: *default
  database: your_api_test

production:
  <<: *default
  database: your_api_production
  username: your_production_username
  password: your_production_password
    
Make sure to update the configurations according to your specific database setup.

Define your API routes in the config/routes.rb file.
This file allows you to define the endpoints and their corresponding controllers and actions. For example:

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :api do
    namespace :v1 do
      resources :users
    end
  end
end

This defines a versioned API with a users resource under the /api/v1 namespace.

Create your controllers in the app/controllers/api/v1 directory. 
These controllers will handle the API requests and responses. 
For example, app/controllers/api/v1/users_controller.rb:

module Api
  module V1
    class UsersController < ApplicationController
      def index
        users = User.all
        render json: users
      end

      def show
        user = User.find(params[:id])
        render json: user
      end

      # Other actions (create, update, destroy) go here
    end
  end
end

In this example, the UsersController responds to index and show actions and returns JSON responses.

Implement your desired API logic within the controllers, including handling request parameters, authentication, authorization, and data manipulation.

Start your Rails server:


rails server
Your API-only Rails application is now running and ready to respond to API requests.

Remember to handle authentication, authorization, and other security measures as needed for your API.
You can use gems like Devise, JWT, or OAuth to implement authentication mechanisms.

By following these steps, you can build a Rails application that serves as an API, providing JSON responses for client applications to consume.

To build an API-only Rails application, you can start with a more limited subset of Rails and add in features as needed.
Here are the steps to create an API-only application in Rails:

Generate a new Rails API app using the rails new command with the --api flag:
rails new my_api --api
This will generate a new Rails API application with a more limited subset of Rails. 
The --api flag removes functionality that is not needed when building an API, such as sessions, cookies, assets,
and anything that makes Rails work on a browser.

Update the ApplicationController to inherit from ActionController::API instead of ActionController::Base:
class ApplicationController < ActionController::API
end
This will leave out any ActionController modules that provide functionality primarily used by browser applications.

Configure the generators to skip generating views, helpers, and assets when generating a new resource:
rails generate resource MyResource --no-template-engine --skip-assets --skip-helper
This will generate a new resource without generating views, helpers, or assets.

Configure the app to use a database or other data storage mechanism as needed.
Here are some key points to keep in mind when building an API-only application in Rails:

An API-only Rails application is a slimmed-down version of a traditional Rails web app that is optimized for building APIs [3] [11].
To create an API-only application, generate a new Rails app with the --api flag [3] [11].
Update the ApplicationController to inherit from ActionController::API instead of ActionController::Base to leave out any ActionController 
        modules that provide functionality primarily used by browser applications [2] [11].
Configure the generators to skip generating views, helpers, and assets when generating a new resource 

Configure the app to use a database or other data storage mechanism as needed [11].
In summary, building an API-only application in Rails is a straightforward process. Once you generate an API-only app 
and configure the ApplicationController and generators, you can start building your API endpoints and data storage mechanism as needed.
