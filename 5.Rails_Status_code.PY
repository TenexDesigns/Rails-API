In Ruby on Rails, HTTP status codes are used to communicate the status
of a request-response cycle between a client and a server.
Rails provides a set of commonly used status codes as constants in the Rack::Utils module.

Here are some of the frequently used HTTP status codes in Rails:

200 OK: The request was successful, and the response contains the requested data.
201 Created: The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result.
204 No Content: The request was successful, but there is no content to send back in the response payload.
400 Bad Request: The server could not understand the request due to malformed syntax or other client-side errors.
401 Unauthorized: The request requires user authentication. The client must provide valid credentials to access the requested resource.
403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but the client does not have permission to access the requested resource.
404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
422 Unprocessable Entity: The server understands the request but cannot process 
  it due to semantic errors or validation failures.
500 Internal Server Error: A generic server error occurred. 
  This status code is used when the server encounters an unexpected condition.
These are just a few examples of the HTTP status codes available in Rails. 
You can find a complete list of HTTP status codes and their descriptions in the Rack::Utils module or the HTTP/1.1 specification.

When working with Rails controllers, you can set the response status code using the render method w
ith the status option, like this:

ruby
Copy code
render json: { message: 'Success' }, status: :ok
In this example, the :ok symbol is used to represent the 200 OK status code.

Remember to choose the appropriate status code that accurately reflects the result of the request
and helps clients understand the outcome of their requests.

In Rails, HTTP status codes can be used to provide meaningful responses to API consumers.
HTTP status codes indicate the nature of the response and provide additional semantic correctness.
Rails provides a layer of abstraction on top of the status codes, making it easy for developers to use
custom status codes in their responses. The render method in Rails allows you to specify HTTP status codes for the response.

Rails provides a set of status codes as symbols that you can use in your responses. 
For example, you can use :ok to indicate a successful response or :not_found to indicate that a resource was not found.
    Here are some common status codes that you can use in your Rails API applications:

:ok (200): The request was successful.
:created (201): The request was successful and a new resource was created.
:accepted (202): The request was accepted for processing but has not yet been completed.
:bad_request (400): The request was malformed or invalid.
:unauthorized (401): The request requires authentication or authorization.
:forbidden (403): The request is not allowed.
:not_found (404): The requested resource was not found.
:unprocessable_entity (422): The request was well-formed but contains semantic errors.
:internal_server_error (500): An error occurred on the server.
You can use these status codes in your Rails API responses by passing them as the status option to the render method.
For example, you can use render json: @resource, status: :created to indicate that a new resource was created.
