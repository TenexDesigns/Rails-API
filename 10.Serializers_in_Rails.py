Serializers in a Rails API app are used to customize the structure and format of the data sent in API responses.
They provide an easy way to control the JSON
output by defining how the models and their associations should be serialized.
Active Model Serializers (AMS) is a popular gem for implementing serializers in Rails applications.

To use AMS, first, add the gem to your Gemfile and run bundle install:

# Gemfile
gem 'active_model_serializers'
Next, generate a serializer for your model, e.g., for a Post model, you can create a PostSerializer:

rails g serializer post
The generated serializer will look like this:

# app/serializers/post_serializer.rb
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id
end
You can customize the serializer by adding more attributes or associations you want to include in the JSON output:

# app/serializers/post_serializer.rb
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :title, :body, :created_at, :updated_at
  belongs_to :author
end
Now, in your controller, Rails will automatically use the serializer when rendering JSON for your models:

# app/controllers/api/v1/posts_controller.rb
class Api::V1::PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    posts = Post.all
    render json: posts
  end
end

In this example, the index action fetches all the posts and then uses the PostSerializer
to transform the collection into a JSON response. This keeps the controller action focused on
handling the request and delegates the presentation of data to the serializer.
