Yes, you can build microservices in Ruby with Rails. Ruby on Rails is a comprehensive framework that grants developers access to a plethora of resources, including tools and libraries, to assist in the development of web applications ¹. 

To build microservices in Ruby with Rails, you can use various gems and dependencies such as:
- **Rack**: Rack is a web server interface for Ruby. You can use Rack to create a web server that runs alongside your main service component ².
- **Sinatra**: Sinatra is a lightweight web application framework for Ruby. You can use Sinatra to create a simple web application that runs alongside your main service component ³.
- **ActiveRecord**: ActiveRecord is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library for Ruby on Rails. You can use ActiveRecord to interact with your database and manage your data models ⁴.

For service registry, you can use **Consul** or **Zookeeper**. Consul is a service mesh solution that provides service discovery, configuration, and segmentation functionality . Zookeeper is a distributed coordination service that provides a hierarchical namespace for distributed systems .

For HTTP communication between microservices, you can use **RESTful APIs** or **gRPC**. RESTful APIs are a popular way to implement communication between microservices. They provide a simple and flexible way to exchange data between services . gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework for building remote procedure call (RPC) APIs .

Other tools that you can use when building microservices in Ruby with Rails include:
- **Docker**: Docker provides an easy way to package your application and its dependencies into a single container that can be run anywhere .
- **Kubernetes**: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications .
- **Prometheus**: Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system that collects metrics from monitored targets and stores them in a time-series database .

I hope this helps!

  Yes, you can build microservices in Ruby with Rails. There are a number of gems and dependencies that you can use to help you build microservices in Ruby and Rails.

Here are some of the dependencies and gems that you may need:

* **Rails API gem:** This gem provides a set of features that are useful for building APIs, such as JSON serialization and routing.
* **Rack CORS gem:** This gem allows you to configure your Rails API to support cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
* **Service discovery gem:** This gem provides a way to find and connect to other services. Some popular service discovery gems include Eureka, Consul, and ZooKeeper.
* **HTTP client gem:** This gem provides a way to make HTTP requests to other services. Some popular HTTP client gems include Faraday, Rest-Client, and HTTParty.
* **Monitoring gem:** This gem provides a way to monitor your microservices. Some popular monitoring gems include Prometheus, Grafana, and Nagios.

In addition to these dependencies and gems, you may also want to use other tools when building microservices in Ruby and Rails. These tools can help you with tasks such as deploying and managing your microservices, testing your microservices, and debugging your microservices.

Here are some of the tools that you may find useful:

* **Docker:** This tool can be used to deploy and manage your microservices in containers.
* **Kubernetes:** This platform can be used to deploy and manage your microservices at scale.
* **RSpec:** This tool can be used to test your microservices.
* **Pry:** This tool can be used to debug your microservices.

I hope this helps!
