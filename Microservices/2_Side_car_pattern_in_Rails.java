Yes, you can build a sidecar in Ruby. The Sidecar Pattern is a microservice decomposition pattern that promotes separation of concerns in microservices architecture ². It allows you to offload processing of some kind to a separate module that gets deployed along with the main service component ¹. The Sidecar Pattern is sometimes referred to as a decomposition pattern ².

In the Sidecar Pattern, a sidecar is a companion application of the main service that typically performs non-JVM tasks such as logging, configuration, monitoring, and networking services . These functionalities can be implemented and run as a separate service within the same container or in a separate container ¹. The Sidecar Pattern achieves the principle of containerization by decoupling the core business logic from additional tasks that extend the original functionality .

To create a sidecar in Ruby, you can use various tools and techniques such as:
- **Docker**: You can use Docker to create a container for your Ruby sidecar application. Docker provides an easy way to package your application and its dependencies into a single container that can be run anywhere ².
- **Sinatra**: Sinatra is a lightweight web application framework for Ruby. You can use Sinatra to create a simple web application that runs alongside your main service component ³.
- **Rack**: Rack is a web server interface for Ruby. You can use Rack to create a web server that runs alongside your main service component ³.

You can also use other tools and techniques depending on your specific requirements.

I hope this helps!
