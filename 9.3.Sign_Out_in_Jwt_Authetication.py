In a Rails API application using JWT authentication,
there isnt a traditional sign out action like in session-based authentication since JWTs 
are stateless and not stored on the server. However, you can implement a "sign out" mechanism on the 
client-side by simply removing the stored token from the client (e.g., local storage, cookies, etc.).
Once the token is removed, the user wont be able to access protected resources until they log in again and obtain a new token.

Heres a simple example of how you can "sign out" a user on the client-side, assuming youre using JavaScript and
storing the JWT token in the browsers local storage:

function signOut() {
  localStorage.removeItem('jwtToken');
}



Note that JWT tokens are usually self-contained, meaning the server does not keep track of issued tokens.
This design allows for horizontal scalability and reduces server-side storage requirements. 
However, it also means that once a token is issued, it remains valid until it expires or is explicitly invalidated.

Its important to keep in mind that JWT tokens should have a reasonably short expiration time to mitigate potential security risks.
Additionally, using HTTPS for API communication is crucial to protect the tokens from interception.

************************************************************************************************************************

In a Rails API app using JWT authentication, signing out typically involves invalidating the access token on the client side.
Since JWTs are stateless and self-contained, there is no server-side session to destroy.
Instead, the client needs to stop using the token for authentication.

To implement sign out in a Rails API app using JWT authentication, you can follow these steps:

Generate and issue a JWT token upon successful authentication.
This token typically contains information about the user and an expiration time.

Store the issued token on the client-side, usually in local storage or a cookie.

When a user wants to sign out, delete or clear the stored token on the client-side.
This effectively invalidates the token and prevents further authenticated requests.

On subsequent API requests, the client will need to include the JWT token in the Authorization header for authentication. 
However, since the token is invalidated, the server will reject the requests as unauthorized.
