To use PostgreSQL in your Rails API app, you need to configure your application to connect to a PostgreSQL database.
Heres a step-by-step guide on how to set up and use PostgreSQL in a Rails API app:

Install PostgreSQL: Ensure that PostgreSQL is installed on your system.
  You can download and install it from the official PostgreSQL website or use a package manager specific to your operating system.

Configure database.yml: Open the config/database.yml file in your Rails application.
  This file contains the database configuration for different environments (development, test, production). Update the configuration to use PostgreSQL:

default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  host: localhost
  username: your_username
  password: your_password

development:
  <<: *default
  database: your_app_development

test:
  <<: *default
  database: your_app_test

production:
  <<: *default
  database: your_app_production
  username: your_production_username
  password: your_production_password
    
Replace your_username and your_password with your PostgreSQL credentials.
Make sure the database names match your application's naming convention.

Install the pg Gem: Add the pg gem to your Gemfile and run bundle install to install the PostgreSQL adapter for Rails:

gem 'pg'
Create the Databases: Run the following commands to create the development and test databases:

rails db:create
This will create the databases specified in your database.yml file.

Migrate the Database: Run any pending migrations to create the necessary database tables:

rails db:migrate
This will create the required tables based on your applications migrations.

Start Using PostgreSQL: Your Rails API app is now configured to use PostgreSQL as the database.
  You can define models, controllers, and other components of your app as usual, and Rails will use PostgreSQL for data storage.
For example, to create a model that uses PostgreSQL, run:


rails generate model User name:string email:string
This will generate a User model with name and email attributes.
Running the migration (rails db:migrate) will create the users table in your PostgreSQL database.

You can perform all the usual ActiveRecord operations like creating, updating, querying, and deleting records using PostgreSQL as the underlying database.

Remember to adjust the configuration in database.yml and follow best practices for securing and managing your PostgreSQL credentials in production environments.

Thats it! You have successfully configured and set up PostgreSQL for your Rails API app.










FOLLOW UP QUESTION ------------->In the above context,  Isee thses three datatbases, development:,test:,production:,
      how do I use the development database, and when developing ,must I fill the test and production database with valid database names
***********************************************************************************************************************


When developing your Rails application, you primarily work with the development database. 
The development database is used for testing and running your application locally during the development phase.
It is where you store and retrieve data while building and testing your application.

During development, you dont necessarily need to fill the test and production databases with valid database names. 
The test database is specifically used for running automated tests, and Rails automatically sets up and manages this database for you.
The production database is used for the live, deployed version of your application.

By default, when you run rails db:create and rails db:migrate, Rails will create the development and test databases based on the configurations specified in the database.yml file.
    The production database is typically set up separately, often on a remote server or cloud provider, 
    and its configuration is usually managed differently (e.g., environment variables) to keep sensitive information secure.

So, during development, you can focus on using and interacting with the development database.
The test and production databases will come into play when you run automated tests or deploy your application to a production environment, respectively.











in the above context, my postgres seerver is running on port 5433, but the rails app is looking for 5432, how do I change the port
***********************************************************************************************************************


To change the port that your Rails application uses to connect to the PostgreSQL server, you can update the host configuration in the database.yml file.
Heres how you can modify the port setting:


default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  host: localhost
  username: your_username
  password: your_password
  port: 5433

development:
  <<: *default
  database: your_app_development

test:
  <<: *default
  database: your_app_test

production:
  <<: *default
  database: your_app_production
  username: your_production_username
  password: your_production_password
In the default section, add the port key and set it to the desired port number (5433 in your case).
Make sure to adjust other sections accordingly if needed, such as the production section.

Save the changes to the database.yml file.
Now, when you run your Rails application, it will use the specified port (5433) to connect to the PostgreSQL server.

Remember to restart your Rails server after making changes to the database.yml file for the new configuration to take effect.
