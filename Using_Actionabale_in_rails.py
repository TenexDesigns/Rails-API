ActionCable is a feature in Rails that enables real-time communication between the server and clients using WebSockets. 
WebSockets provide a bi-directional, full-duplex communication channel that allows the server to push updates to the clients
without requiring the clients to poll the server for new information. This can lead to more efficient and responsive applications,
especially in scenarios where real-time updates or interactions are important, such as chat applications, notifications, 
or collaborative editing tools dev.to.

ActionCable is used in situations where you need to maintain an open connection between the client and the server,
allowing for real-time communication and updates. With ActionCable, you can create channels that clients can subscribe to,
and broadcast messages to all subscribers when events occur. This enables you to build features that require instant updates
or interactions between users. However, its important to note that ActionCable might not be suitable for every situation, 
especially when latency is a critical factor or when your application requires a distributed architecture with servers
located in multiple data centers ably.com.

In summary, ActionCable is a powerful tool for building real-time features in Rails applications, 
allowing for efficient communication between the server and clients. Its particularly useful for
scenarios that require live updates or interactions, but it might not be the best choice for applications with
stringent latency requirements or distributed architectures samuelmullen.com.







USING ACTIONABLE
**************************************************************************************


To use Action Cable in a Rails API app, you can follow these steps to implement real-time WebSocket communication:

Set up Action Cable:

Ensure that your Rails app includes the Action Cable framework. 
Its included by default in Rails 5.0 and above.
Run rails g channel <ChannelName> to generate a new channel. Replace <ChannelName> with the desired name for your channel.
This will create a channel file in the app/channels directory.
Configure Action Cable:

Open config/cable.yml and ensure that the adapter option is set to redis. 
This configuration allows Action Cable to use Redis as a pub-sub backend for
broadcasting messages across multiple instances of your application.
Set up Redis:

Make sure you have Redis installed and running on your system.
You can install Redis using package managers like apt or brew.
Start the Redis server by running redis-server in your terminal.
Implement your channel:

Open the generated channel file in app/channels (e.g., app/channels/my_channel.rb).
Define the desired behavior for your channel by implementing the subscribed and other callback methods. For example:

class MyChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    stream_from "my_channel"
  end

  def receive(data)
    ActionCable.server.broadcast("my_channel", data)
  end
end
In the example above, the subscribed method is used to specify which stream to subscribe to. 
The receive method broadcasts the received data to all subscribers.
Mount Action Cable:

Open config/routes.rb and add the following line to mount the Action Cable server:

mount ActionCable.server => '/cable'
Use Action Cable in your API endpoints:

In your API controller, you can use Action Cable to broadcast messages or send updates to connected clients. For example:

def create
  # Process the request and save the data
  data = { message: 'New data created' }
  ActionCable.server.broadcast('my_channel', data)
  render json: { success: true }
end
In the example above, the create action broadcasts a message to all subscribers of the 'my_channel'.
Set up the client-side WebSocket connection:

In your client-side application, establish a WebSocket connection to the Action Cable server.
For example, using JavaScript and the actioncable package:

import consumer from 'channels/consumer'

const cable = consumer()
const channel = cable.subscriptions.create('MyChannel', {
  received(data) {
    // Handle received data
  }
})

In the example above, the consumer method creates a connection to the Action Cable server,
and cable.subscriptions.create subscribes to the 'MyChannel'.
By following these steps, you can implement real-time WebSocket communication using Action Cable
in your Rails API app. Action Cable provides features like broadcasting, streaming, and pub-sub messaging, 
allowing you to build real-time functionalities such as chat systems, notifications, and live updates. 
Remember to configure and deploy your application appropriately, including setting up a production-grade 
Redis server and configuring load balancing if needed.
