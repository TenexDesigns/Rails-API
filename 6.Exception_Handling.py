Exception handling in Rails API controllers allows you to handle and customize the response when
an exception occurs during the processing of a request.
Here are some approaches to handle exceptions in Rails API controllers:


1.Use rescue_from to handle specific exceptions: 
  ActionController provides a rescue_from method which 
  can be used to handle errors raised from the controller. 
  You can define a rescue_from block in your ApplicationController to handle specific
  exceptions and return a JSON response with the appropriate status code.
For example, you can handle ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound exceptions with the following

  
     class ApplicationController < ActionController::API
     rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, with: :record_not_found

     private

     def record_not_found
       render json: { error: 'Record not found' }, status: :not_found
     end
   end





2.Rescue from Specific Exceptions:
You can rescue specific exceptions and define custom behavior for each one. 
For example, to handle a StandardError exception, you can write the following code in your controller:

class MyController < ApplicationController
  rescue_from StandardError, with: :handle_error

  def my_action
    # Code that may raise an exception
  end

  private

  def handle_error(exception)
    # Custom error handling logic
    render json: { error: exception.message }, status: :internal_server_error
  end
end

In this example, the rescue_from method is used to rescue the StandardError exception 
and execute the handle_error method, which can be defined to handle the exception in a specific way.
You can customize the response or take appropriate actions based on the exception.









3.Rescue from Specific Exceptions:
You can rescue specific exceptions and define custom behavior for each one.
For example, to handle a StandardError exception, you can write the following code in your controller:


class MyController < ApplicationController
  rescue_from StandardError, with: :handle_error

  def my_action
    # Code that may raise an exception
  end

  private

  def handle_error(exception)
    # Custom error handling logic
    render json: { error: exception.message }, status: :internal_server_error
  end
end
In this example, the rescue_from method is used to rescue the StandardError exception and execute the handle_error method,
which can be defined to handle the exception in a specific way.
You can customize the response or take appropriate actions based on the exception.









4.Use a gem like exception_handler: exception_handler is a gem that provides a unified way to handle exceptions
  across your entire Rails application. It allows you to define custom error messages and responses for specific exceptions,
  and provides a central place to manage all your error handling logic.
  To use exception_handler, you can add it to your Gemfile and follow the instructions in the documentation.











5.Use a custom error serializer: A custom error serializer can be used to serialize errors in 
  a more structured and consistent way. This approach involves defining a custom serializer 
  that maps errors to a JSON API-compliant format. You can then use the render method to return a 
JSON response with the appropriate status code and serialized error message. 
Here's an example of how to define a custom error serializer:
   class ErrorSerializer
     def self.serialize(errors)
       return if errors.nil?

       json = {}
       new_hash = errors.to_hash(true).map do |k, v|
         v.map do |msg|
           { id: k, title: msg }
         end
       end.flatten
       json[:errors] = new_hash
       json
     end
   end
You can then use the custom error serializer in your controllers like this:

   class UsersController < ApplicationController
     def create
       user = User.new(user_params)

       if user.save
         render json: user, status: :created
       else
         render json: ErrorSerializer.serialize(user.errors), status: :unprocessable_entity
       end
     end
   end
These are just a few of the approaches to exception handling in Rails API-only apps. 
You can choose the approach that best fits your needs and the needs of your application.










6.Global Exception Handling:
Rails also provides the option to define a global exception handler that will catch any unhandled exceptions in your application.
This can be done by adding the following code to your config/application.rb file:

ruby
Copy code
config.exceptions_app = ->(env) { ExceptionController.action(:show).call(env) }
Then, you can create an ExceptionController with an appropriate show action to handle the exceptions and render the desired response.

ruby
Copy code
class ExceptionController < ApplicationController
  def show
    exception = env['action_dispatch.exception']
    # Custom error handling logic
    render json: { error: exception.message }, status: :internal_server_error
  end
end
This global exception handler will catch any unhandled exceptions and route them to the show action 
of the ExceptionController to handle the error response.














These are some common approaches to handle exceptions in Rails API controllers.
You can choose the method that best suits your applications requirements and customize the error handling logic accordingly.
