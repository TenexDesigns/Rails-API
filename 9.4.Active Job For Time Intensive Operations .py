Active Job is a feature in Ruby on Rails that allows you to handle time-intensive operations asynchronously.
It provides a unified interface to enqueue and execute background jobs using various job processing backends like Sidekiq,
Delayed Job, Resque, or even the default inline execution mode. By offloading time-consuming tasks to background jobs,
your Rails API app can improve responsiveness and overall performance.

Heres how you can use Active Job for time-intensive operations in a Rails API app:

Set up Active Job: Active Job is built into Rails, so you dont need to install any additional gems.
  However, you may need to configure a specific job processing backend, such as Sidekiq or Delayed Job.
  Refer to the documentation of your chosen job processing library for installation and configuration instructions.

Create a job class: Generate a new job class using the Rails generator.
  For example, to create a job called MyJob, run the following command:

rails generate job MyJob
This will create a file named my_job.rb in the app/jobs directory.

Implement the job logic: Open the my_job.rb file and define the behavior of the job.
  The perform method will be executed when the job is processed.

class MyJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default

  def perform(*args)
    # Perform time-intensive operations here
  end
end
Replace the comment with the actual time-intensive operations that need to be executed asynchronously.

Enqueue the job: In your controller or wherever you need to trigger the time-intensive operation,
  enqueue the job using the perform_later method.

def some_action
  MyJob.perform_later(*args)
  # Other controller logic
end
Replace *args with any arguments required by your job.

Start the job processing backend: Depending on the job processing backend you chose, 
  start the corresponding process to handle background jobs.
  For example, if youre using Sidekiq, start the Sidekiq process by running bundle exec sidekiq.

Monitor job execution: The job processing backend will now process the enqueued jobs asynchronously in the background.
  You can monitor the job execution and view logs or status updates from the job processing backend.

By using Active Job, you can delegate time-intensive operations to background jobs and free up your 
Rails API app to handle other requests without blocking. 
This allows your app to remain responsive and ensures a smooth user experience.
Remember to choose a job processing backend that suits your applications needs and follow 
the corresponding setup and configuration instructions for that backend.





EXAMPLE OF INTENSIVE TASKS AND HOW TO USE SIDQK
********************************************************************************************************************8

Examples of time-intensive operations include:

Sending bulk emails or notifications
Processing images or videos
Generating reports
Web scraping
Performing complex calculations
Accessing third-party APIs with rate limits or slow responses




To execute a time-intensive operation using Sidekiq as the background processing backend, follow these steps:

1.Add Sidekiq to your Gemfile and run bundle install:
# Gemfile
gem 'sidekiq'

2.Configure Active Job to use Sidekiq as the queue adapter in config/application.rb:
config.active_job.queue_adapter = :sidekiq
  
3.Create a new job using the Rails generator:
rails generate job MyJob
This will create a new file my_job.rb in the app/jobs directory.


4.Update the perform method in the MyJob class to include the time-intensive operation you want to perform in the background:
class MyJob < ActiveJob::Base
  queue_as :default

  def perform(*args)
    # Perform the time-intensive operation here
  end
end


5.Enqueue the job from your controller or model:
MyJob.perform_later(args)

6.Set up Sidekiq and Redis. Install Redis on your system if you havent already.
You can find the installation instructions for various platforms in the official Redis documentation.

7.Start the Sidekiq worker process by running the following command in the terminal:
bundle exec sidekiq

Now, when you enqueue the job, Sidekiq will process it in the background.

For more information on Sidekiq, refer to the









CODE SAMPLES OF INTESIVE TASKS
***********************************************************************************************************

There are various examples of time-intensive operations that can benefit from being executed asynchronously using 
a job processing backend like Sidekiq. Here are a few examples:

Sending Emails: Sending emails can be a time-consuming task, especially when you have a large number of 
  recipients or complex email templates. By moving email sending to a background job,
  you can enqueue the job to process it asynchronously, allowing your Rails API app to respond quickly to user requests.

class EmailJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default

  def perform(user_id, message)
    user = User.find(user_id)
    UserMailer.send_email(user, message).deliver_now
  end
end
In this example, the EmailJob class sends an email to a user identified by user_id with the provided message. 
The UserMailer.send_email method represents the email sending logic.

Image Processing: Image processing operations, such as resizing or cropping images, can be computationally intensive.
  By offloading these operations to a background job, you can ensure that your API app remains responsive during the image processing.


class ImageProcessingJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default

  def perform(image_id)
    image = Image.find(image_id)
    image.process!
  end
end
In this example, the ImageProcessingJob class retrieves an image by its image_id 
and performs the image processing operation using the image.process! method.

Data Import/Export: Importing or exporting large amounts of data from external sources or APIs can take a significant amount of time.
  By utilizing a background job, you can initiate the import/export process and let it run asynchronously 
  while keeping your API app responsive.


class DataImportExportJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default

  def perform(import_export_id)
    import_export = ImportExport.find(import_export_id)
    import_export.perform_import_export!
  end
end
In this example, the DataImportExportJob class retrieves an import/export task by its import_export_id and executes
the data import/export using the import_export.perform_import_export! method.

To execute these jobs using Sidekiq as the job processing backend, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Sidekiq set up in your Rails application.
Refer to the Sidekiq documentation for installation and configuration instructions.

Start the Sidekiq process by running bundle exec sidekiq in your terminal.

Enqueue the jobs wherever you need them, using the perform_later method:


EmailJob.perform_later(user.id, "Hello, there!")
ImageProcessingJob.perform_later(image.id)
DataImportExportJob.perform_later(import_export.id)
Replace the arguments with the appropriate values required by your specific job.

Sidekiq will process the enqueued jobs asynchronously in the background.
You can monitor the Sidekiq dashboard or logs to track the progress and status of the executed jobs.









1. -  Sidekiq  installation and configuration  IN MY RAILS API APP
***********************************************************************************************************


To install and configure Sidekiq in your Rails API app, follow these steps:

Add the sidekiq and redis gems to your Gemfile and run bundle install:
# Gemfile
gem 'redis'
gem 'sidekiq'
Configure Active Job to use Sidekiq as the queue adapter in config/application.rb:
# config/application.rb
class Application < Rails::Application
  config.active_job.queue_adapter = :sidekiq
  # ...
end
Create a Sidekiq configuration file in the config directory, for example, config/sidekiq.yml:
# config/sidekiq.yml
---
:concurrency: 5
:queues:
  - default
Create an initializer file for Sidekiq in config/initializers/sidekiq.rb:
# config/initializers/sidekiq.rb
require 'sidekiq'

Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
  config.redis = { url: 'redis://localhost:6379/0' }
end

Sidekiq.configure_client do |config|
  config.redis = { url: 'redis://localhost:6379/0' }
end
Replace 'redis://localhost:6379/0' with the appropriate Redis URL if
youre using a remote Redis server or a different port.

Install Redis on your system if you havent already. You can find the installation instructions for various 
platforms in the official Redis documentation.
Start the Sidekiq worker process by running the following command in the terminal:
bundle exec sidekiq
Now, Sidekiq is installed and configured in your Rails API app. You can enqueue jobs using Active Job,
and Sidekiq will process them in the background.

For more information on Sidekiq, refer to the






2. -  Sidekiq  installation and configuration  IN MY RAILS API APP
***********************************************************************************************************

To install and configure Sidekiq in your Rails API app, follow these steps:

Add Sidekiq to your Gemfile: Open your Gemfile and add the following line:
gem 'redis'
gem 'sidekiq'
Then, run bundle install to install the gem.

Set up the Redis server: Sidekiq uses Redis as its backend for job processing.
  Ensure that Redis is installed and running on your system. 
  You can download and install Redis from the official website (https://redis.io/download) or 
  use a managed Redis service like Redis Cloud or Heroku Redis.

Configure Sidekiq: Create a config/sidekiq.yml file and add the following configuration settings:

# config/sidekiq.yml
:concurrency: 5
:queues:
  - default
  - mailers
  - other_queue
Adjust the concurrency value according to your needs. It determines how many Sidekiq worker processes can run simultaneously.
The queues section specifies the queues that Sidekiq should monitor for jobs.

Configure Redis connection: Update your Rails configuration file (config/application.rb or config/environments/*.rb) 
  to specify the Redis connection details. Add or modify the following line:


# config/application.rb or config/environments/*.rb
config.redis = { url: 'redis://localhost:6379/0' }
Update the url value if your Redis server is running on a different host or port.

Start Sidekiq: Run the Sidekiq process by executing the following command in your terminal:


bundle exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml
This starts the Sidekiq process and configures it to use the config/sidekiq.yml file for configuration.

Enqueue and process jobs: Now, you can enqueue jobs using the perform_later method
  as shown in the previous examples. Sidekiq will automatically pick up the enqueued jobs 
  and process them asynchronously in the background.


EmailJob.perform_later(user.id, "Hello, there!")
ImageProcessingJob.perform_later(image.id)
Sidekiq will process the enqueued jobs based on the specified concurrency and queue configuration.

Thats it! You have successfully installed and configured Sidekiq in your Rails API app. 
You can now utilize the power of background job processing for time-intensive tasks.
Monitor the Sidekiq dashboard or logs to keep track of job execution and any potential issues.
