There are several ways to deploy your Rails app on AWS, depending on your requirements and preferences. Here are some options:

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): You can deploy your Rails app on an EC2 instance, which provides you with a virtual server in the cloud.
  Youll need to set up and configure the necessary software (e.g., web server, application server, and database) on the instance.
  You can follow this SitePoint tutorial that explains how to deploy a Rails app to AWS using Capistrano with a Puma, Nginx, and 
  PostgreSQL stack. Another option is this YouTube tutorial that walks through deploying a Rails app on an EC2 instance.

OpsWorks: AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that uses Chef to automate the deployment, scaling, 
  and management of applications. You can deploy your Rails app to OpsWorks by following this AWS blog post,
  which explains how to deploy a Rails app to OpsWorks with the application and database running on separate instances.
  
Elastic Beanstalk: AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy, manage,
  and scale applications, including Rails apps. You can simply upload your code, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles
  the deployment, scaling, monitoring, and maintenance of your app. To deploy your Rails app to Elastic Beanstalk,
  you can follow the official AWS documentation.
  
Each of these options has its own advantages and trade-offs. EC2 gives you the most control and flexibility,
but it also requires more manual setup and maintenance.
OpsWorks provides more automation with Chef, while Elastic Beanstalk is the most hands-off option, 
taking care of most aspects for you. Choose the one that best fits your needs and preferences.
