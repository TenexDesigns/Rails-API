API keys are unique identifiers used to authenticate clients and grant access to an API.
By using API keys, you can control who has access to your API and track usage. 
Rate limiting is a technique to control the number of requests a client can make to your API within a certain time frame.
This helps protect your API from overuse, both unintentional and malicious, and ensures a healthy and stable service 
for all users freecodecamp.org, baeldung.com.

To implement API keys and rate limiting in your Rails API app, you can follow these steps:

Create an API key model: Generate a new model for API keys, which will store the unique identifier for each client:
   rails generate model ApiKey access_token:string
Add a unique index to the access_token column in the migration file:

   # db/migrate/..._create_api_keys.rb
   add_index :api_keys, :access_token, unique: true
Run rails db:migrate to apply the migration.

Generate API keys: In the ApiKey model, generate a unique access token before creating a new record:
   # app/models/api_key.rb
   class ApiKey < ApplicationRecord
     before_create :generate_access_token

     private

     def generate_access_token
       loop do
         self.access_token = SecureRandom.hex(24)
         break unless ApiKey.exists?(access_token: access_token)
       end
     end
   end
Authenticate requests: Create a new controller concern called ApiAuthentication to authenticate requests using the API key:
   # app/controllers/concerns/api_authentication.rb
   module ApiAuthentication
     extend ActiveSupport::Concern

     included do
       before_action :authenticate_api_key
     end

     private

     def authenticate_api_key
       api_key = request.headers['X-Api-Key']
       @api_key = ApiKey.find_by(access_token: api_key)
       render json: { error: 'Unauthorized' }, status: :unauthorized unless @api_key
     end
   end
Include this concern in controllers where you want to enforce API key authentication:

   # app/controllers/api/v1/some_controller.rb
   class Api::V1::SomeController < ApplicationController
     include ApiAuthentication
   end
Implement rate limiting: You can use the Rack::Attack gem to implement rate limiting. 
      Add it to your Gemfile and run bundle install:
   gem 'rack-attack'
Create an initializer for Rack::Attack:

   # config/initializers/rack_attack.rb
   class Rack::Attack
     Rack::Attack.cache.store = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new

     # Set up a rate limit for API keys
     throttle('api_key_limit', limit: 100, period: 1.minute) do |req|
       req.env['HTTP_X_API_KEY']
     end
   end

   Rails.application.config.middleware.use Rack::Attack
This configuration sets a limit of 100 requests per minute for each API key.
You can customize the limit and period according to your requirements.

By following these steps, you can implement API keys and rate limiting in your Rails API app to protect your 
API from overuse and ensure a stable service for all users. This example demonstrates a basic implementation,
but you can customize it according to your requirements, such as using different rate limits for different clients,
or combining API keys with other authentication methods sadique.io, dev.to.

API keys and rate limiting are important security and performance features commonly used in Rails API apps to control access to APIs 
and prevent abuse or unauthorized usage. Heres an explanation of API keys and rate limiting, as well as how
to implement them in a Rails API app:

API Keys:

API keys are unique identifiers that are used to authenticate and authorize clients accessing an API. 
They act as a secret token that clients must include in their requests to identify themselves and gain access to protected resources.
API keys can be generated and issued to clients when they register or authenticate with your API.
Each client is assigned a unique API key that they need to include in their requests as a form of authentication.
API keys can be sent as a header (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>) or as a query parameter 
(e.g., ?api_key=<API_KEY>). The method of sending API keys depends on your API design and security requirements.
To implement API key authentication in a Rails API app, you can use a middleware or a before_action 
filter in your controllers to check and validate the API key sent by the client. 
If the API key is invalid or missing, you can respond with an appropriate error message or status code.
Rate Limiting:

Rate limiting is a technique used to control the number of API requests a client can make within a certain time period.
It helps prevent abuse, protect server resources, and ensure fair usage of the API.
Rate limiting is typically implemented by setting limits on the number of requests a client can make within 
a specific timeframe (e.g., 100 requests per hour).
When a client exceeds the rate limit, the API can respond with a designated HTTP status code (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) 
and include relevant headers to indicate the remaining time until the rate limit resets.
To implement rate limiting in a Rails API app, you can use middleware or third-party libraries that provide rate limiting
functionality. These libraries often provide configuration options to set the rate limits, track request counts,
and handle rate limit exceeded scenarios.
Heres an example of how you can implement API key authentication and rate limiting in a Rails API app using a middleware:

Install the necessary gems:


gem 'rack-api-key'
gem 'rack-attack'
Configure the API key middleware in config/application.rb:

config.middleware.use Rack::ApiKey, api_key_header: 'X-API-Key'
Configure rate limiting in config/initializers/rack_attack.rb:


Rack::Attack.throttle('api/requests', limit: 100, period: 1.hour) do |req|
  req.ip if req.path.start_with?('/api/')
end
With the above configuration, every API request will be checked for a valid API key using the X-API-Key header.
Additionally, rate limiting will be applied to API requests, allowing a maximum of 100 requests per hour from each IP address.

Remember to adjust the configuration based on your specific requirements, such as choosing the appropriate 
header for API keys and setting the desired rate limits.

Implementing API keys and rate limiting adds an extra layer of security and control to your Rails API app,
allowing you to authenticate clients and manage the usage of your API effectively.
